# Scroll performance demo

This demo project aims to showcase how the following aspects affect Flutter scroll performance

- `ListView(children:)` vs `ListView.builder` constructors
- `shrinkWrap` paremater and its relation to `itemExtent` parameter
- Using classes for elements vs using methods
- Adding "heavy" widgets such as `Image.network` to each element
